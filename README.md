## Features

When making this app we wanted to have a functioning form to create each grocery item. We also made an edit form and a list section that separates your list items by category.

## User Stories

As a user I want to be able to add things to my list at any time so I don't forget anything while shopping.
As a user I want to be able to create, read, update, and delete items so I can maintain my list as I please.
