## Description

Cart start is a grocery list creator application. We wanted to make a useful and fun app that helps you organize your grocery list by department. Hopefully you will enjoy it and use it for your next trip to the store!

## Features

When making this app we wanted to have a functioning form to create each grocery item. We also made an edit form and a list section that separates your list items by category.

## User Stories

As a user i want to be able to make a list of items I need before I go shopping for groceries so I can stay organized. As a user I want to be able to add things to my list wt any time so I don't forget anything while shopping.

## Technologies Used:

For this app we used [React], [HTML], [CSS], and [Javascript]. We also used our API we created to store our grocery list items [https://cart-start.herokuapp.com].
